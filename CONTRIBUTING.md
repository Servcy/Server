# Contributing to Servcy

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to Servcy! All kinds of contributions are valuable to us. In this guide, we will cover how you can quickly onboard and make your first contribution.

## Submitting an issue

Before submitting a new issue, please search the [issues](https://github.com/Servcy/Landing/issues) tab. Maybe an issue or discussion already exists and might inform you of workarounds. Otherwise, you can give new informplaneation.

While we want to fix all the [issues](https://github.com/Servcy/Landing/issues), before fixing a bug we need to be able to reproduce and confirm it. Please provide us with a minimal reproduction scenario using a repository or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us the information without asking questions back & forth with additional questions like:

- 3rd-party libraries being used and their versions
- a use-case that fails

Without said minimal reproduction, we won't be able to investigate all [issues](https://github.com/Servcy/Landing/issues), and the issue might not be resolved.

You can open a new issue with this [issue form](https://github.com/Servcy/Landing/issues/new).

## Missing a Feature?

If a feature is missing, you can directly _request_ a new one [here](https://github.com/Servcy/Landing/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.yml&title=%F0%9F%9A%80+Feature%3A+). You also can do the same by choosing "ðŸš€ Feature" when raising a [New Issue](https://github.com/Servcy/Landing/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to _implement_ it, an issue with your proposal must be submitted first, to be sure that we can use it. Please consider the guidelines given below.

## Coding guidelines

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, please keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- We use [Eslint default rule guide](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/), with minor changes. An automated formatter is available using prettier.
